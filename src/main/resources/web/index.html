    <p>
        This app helps you set up an AppRunner app by creating a Git repo on your GitHub account, adding a sample
        app to the repo, and registering that app with AppRunner.
    </p>

    <p>To get started, you first need to grant access to AppCreator to create a repo in your account:</p>
